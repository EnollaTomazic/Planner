# Repository Guidelines

This file provides instructions for all contributors.

## Coding Standards
- Write TypeScript/React code following the project's Prettier and ESLint configurations (2â€‘space indent, semicolons, double quotes, trailing commas).
- Reuse primitives and follow the design system documented in [docs/design-system.md](docs/design-system.md).
- Whenever you create a new style or component, add it to the prompts page (`src/app/prompts/page.tsx`).

## Scripts
- Regenerate the UI component index with `npm run regen-ui` after adding, removing, or renaming UI components.
- A future `npm run regen-feature` will update feature scaffolding; run it once available.
- For long-running scripts, use the progress helpers in `src/utils/progress.ts` to display CLI progress bars.

## Testing
- Run `npm run check` before committing; it runs `npm test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run typecheck`.
- Only commit when all checks pass.
