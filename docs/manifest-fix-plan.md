# Plan to Fix Gallery Manifest Object Structure

1. Inspect `src/components/gallery/generated-manifest.ts` (and any upstream generator such as `scripts/build-gallery-usage.ts`) to confirm that the first entry in `galleryPayload.sections[0].entries` is missing its opening `{` brace.
2. Update the manifest generator (or the manifest file if it is checked into source control) so that every entry in the `entries` array is wrapped inside a complete object literal. Ensure the fix maintains formatting conventions (2-space indentation, single quotes, trailing commas).
3. Regenerate the manifest using the appropriate script (`pnpm run build-gallery-usage` or related regeneration command) and rerun repository checks (`pnpm run check`) to verify the manifest compiles and all tests continue to pass.
