# Repository Review

## Project Overview
- **Framework & runtime**: Next.js 15 with the App Router, paired with React 19 and a Suspense-driven landing page fallback that adapts to feature flags.
- **Design system**: Centralized styling via generated tokens and shared hero fallback layouts that keep the home experience resilient when client hydration is pending.
- **Automation & scripts**: Rich pnpm scripts manage regeneration of UI barrels, design tokens, and deploy pipelines while bundling linting, testing, and artifact guards into a single `pnpm run check` quality gate.

## Architecture Highlights
1. The home route is implemented as a static Next.js page that streams a `HomePlannerIsland` client component behind a Suspense boundary, falling back to structured skeleton content so the layout stays navigable during hydration. Feature flags switch between glitch and legacy fallbacks without branching the route definition.
2. Client feature toggles reuse a shared environment reader and tolerant boolean parsing helper, allowing multiple environment variables to map to the same toggle while defaulting safely when values are missing or malformed.
3. Automation scripts favour typed entry points (via `tsx`) to regenerate component registries, tokens, and deployment artifacts, reducing drift between design assets and production builds.

## Strengths
- **Documentation depth**: The README walks through installation, environment setup, deployment automation, and AI safeguards in exceptional detail, lowering onboarding friction for contributors.
- **Guardrails in tooling**: The composite `pnpm run check` script orchestrates testing, linting, type checking, and artifact validation concurrently, making it easy to enforce repository standards in local and CI workflows.
- **Fallback-first UI**: Landing page skeletons and hero sections have semantic headings, labelled regions, and animated placeholders, maintaining accessibility while communicating loading state.
- **Feature-flag hygiene**: Server and client share boolean parsing logic so toggles behave predictably even when legacy and new environment variables coexist.

## Risks & Opportunities
1. **Node version guidance drifts**: The README requires Node >=22.12, but the `package.json` engine range still allows >=20.17.0. Aligning these expectations will prevent tooling confusion for developers pinning to the documented version.
2. **Centralized review artifact**: Consider adding a contribution checklist or architecture summary (perhaps under `docs/`) that distills the automation expectations from `AGENTS.md` and the README; the current review attempts to provide that map, but a living document in-repo would benefit new maintainers.
3. **Quality gate runtime**: `pnpm run check` spawns tests, multiple ESLint runs, type checking, and artifact guards simultaneously. Documenting the typical runtime or providing scoped aliases (e.g., `pnpm run check:fast`) could help contributors prioritize incremental feedback loops.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Update either the README or `package.json` engines to agree on the minimum supported Node LTS, then communicate the change in onboarding docs and CI.
- Capture the repository guardrails (UI regeneration, artifact cleaning, deploy expectations) in a newcomer-facing checklist so they remain top-of-mind outside `AGENTS.md`.
- Evaluate whether splitting the quality gate into staged commands (quick vs. full) would speed up local iteration without weakening CI enforcement.
