Planner is a collaborative product-planning workspace that blends AI-guided ideation with shared roadmaps, reusable UI primitives, and release orchestration so teams can move from concept to shipping plans in one place.

For repository-wide conventions, automation entry points, and required pre-commit checks, read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). The guide summarizes the scripts that keep the UI index, feature exports, and GitHub Pages deploy pipeline healthy.

> **Heads up for developers and agents:** `AGENTS.md` is the canonical source for setup, testing, deployment, and code-style expectations. Always re-check it (and any nested versions) before making changes.

## Installation

Set up the project with the standard pnpm workflow:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Getting Started

> **Prerequisite:** Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) >=22.12 and <23 (the active Node 22 LTS range) along with pnpm 10.18.2 to match the repository engines. Other releases may still run, but expect reduced support and additional warnings.
>
> The project ships an [.nvmrc](.nvmrc) file pinned to Node 22.12.0 so that `nvm use` or compatible version managers select the supported runtime automatically during development and CI.

### Installation

1. Install dependencies and generate the component registry:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and adjust values as needed for your environment before running the dev server.
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

The dev script runs `pnpm run prebuild` to refresh autogenerated indexes before launching the local server. It also triggers `pnpm run regen-ui`, which keeps the component barrel file up to date. Run `pnpm run regen-ui` manually whenever components are added or removed outside the install/dev cycle.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`; the page auto-updates as you edit the file. The project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

### Cleaning runtime artifacts

If `pnpm run check` or `pnpm run guard:artifacts` detect lingering `node-compile-cache` or `tsx-*` directories, run `pnpm run clean:artifacts` to remove them before retrying. The guard now only warns in CI to avoid failing unrelated jobs, but local runs still exit with an error so caches get cleaned before you commit. The command deletes the caches created by `tsx` so the guard passes on the next run.

### Resetting GitHub Actions caches

The CI, deployment, and workflow lint pipelines reuse the `.github/actions/setup-node-project` composite action to restore `node_modules` from the Actions cache. When a cache restore causes unexpected build failures, set the `NODE_MODULES_CACHE_BUSTER` repository variable (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables) to a new value such as the current date. The workflows append that value to the cache key via the action's `cache-suffix` input, so updating the variable forces a fresh dependency install without modifying the workflow files. Remove the variable or clear its value after the new cache has been created to fall back to the default key.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

Run `pnpm run deploy` (or `npm run deploy`) from the project root whenever you're ready to publish. The `deploy:pages` script rebuilds the site with the correct GitHub Pages base path (`GITHUB_PAGES=true` and `BASE_PATH=<repo>`), then calls the [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) CLI with `--nojekyll` so the `.nojekyll` marker is always published. Set `GH_PAGES_BRANCH` (or `GITHUB_PAGES_BRANCH`) if your site publishes from a branch other than the repository's default branch (detected automatically, falling back to `gh-pages`) so the deploy script targets the same branch you serve from. The deploy command now enforces that GitHub Pages and the default branch stay aligned—override the branch via the environment variables if you intentionally serve from a different branch.

Regardless of how you publish the static files, ensure the exported artifact contains `.nojekyll` so GitHub Pages doesn't strip the `_next/` assets. The repository now checks in a [`public/.nojekyll`](public/.nojekyll) placeholder, which keeps the marker inside the generated `out/.nojekyll` during `pnpm run export`. If you bypass the deploy script, copy that file alongside `_next/**` when you upload the export so GitHub Pages serves the bundled assets correctly.

After the first run, visit **Settings → Pages** in the GitHub UI and confirm the source matches the branch or "GitHub Actions" artifact you publish to. When the status banner reports "Your site is live" with the expected URL (for example, `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`), reload that address to verify the exported app is being served instead of the repository README.

Before building, the script verifies that a Git push target is configured. If `git remote get-url origin` fails and both `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` are missing, the deploy exits early and asks you to add an `origin` remote or supply those environment variables before re-running `pnpm run deploy` or `npm run deploy`.

The CI workflow runs a **Validate env for deploy** step before exporting. It executes `scripts/validate-deploy-env.ts`, which reuses the slug detection rules from [`next.config.mjs`](next.config.mjs) (based on `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`) to confirm the GitHub Pages base path is configured correctly. When the repository publishes to `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`, the check expects `BASE_PATH=<repo>` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/<repo>`. User/organization GitHub Pages sites (slugs that already end in `.github.io`) should leave both variables empty. If the validation fails, update the variables in your shell, `.env.local`, or CI secrets until the logged "actual" values match the "expected" ones.

When the static files are published to `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`, the home page is served from `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/` rather than the domain root. Use that base path whenever you link to or bookmark the deployed site. Only repositories that exactly match `https://<username>.github.io` (user/organization GitHub Pages) skip the base path; similarly named repositories such as `docs.github.io` owned by another organization continue to publish under `/<repo>/`.

For CI (or any environment that should push automatically), export `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, and (optionally) `CI=true` before running the deploy script. When those values are present, the script adds an authenticated remote URL so the push succeeds without additional setup.

Running locally is zero-config in most cases as long as an `origin` remote exists—the script can infer the repository slug from `BASE_PATH`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, your Git remote, or even the folder name if needed. You only need to set `BASE_PATH` manually if none of those sources are available.

To mirror the GitHub Pages behavior in development, provide the repository slug with `BASE_PATH` while enabling the GitHub Pages flag. For example:

```bash
GITHUB_PAGES=true BASE_PATH=<repo> pnpm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000/<repo>/` to load the home page under the same base path.

## Configuration Reference

The app reads configuration from your shell environment at build time. Use `.env.local` for local development and your CI provider's secret manager for deployments. The table below lists the available keys, their defaults in `.env.example`, and how they influence the app:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BASE_PATH` | `""` | Repository slug added to exported asset URLs. Required for GitHub Pages deployments so the static site serves from `/<repo>/`. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` | `""` | Browser-visible base path. Mirror `BASE_PATH` when `GITHUB_PAGES` is `true` to keep runtime navigation and asset fetching in sync. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_METRICS` | `"auto"` | Controls the browser web vitals hook. `auto` only ships metrics in production when a metrics endpoint is configured; set to `true`/`false` to force enable or disable respectively. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_METRICS_ENDPOINT` | `""` | Absolute or relative URL the browser uses for web vitals submissions. Leave empty to disable metrics when hosting static exports without a backend. |
| `SAFE_MODE` | `true` | Server-side safe mode for AI-assisted tooling. Leave enabled in production to enforce conservative token budgets and guardrails; disable locally when you need unrestricted profiling or debugging. |
| `AI_MAX_INPUT_LENGTH` | `"16000"` | Default grapheme cap applied when sanitizing prompts. Increase when your provider accepts longer inputs; decrease to enforce tighter limits. |
| `AI_TOKENS_PER_CHAR` | `"3"` | Heuristic tokens-per-character ratio used when estimating budgets without provider-specific metadata. Lowering the ratio to 3 overestimates usage slightly so prompts stay within response limits. |
| `SAFE_MODE_TOKEN_CEILING` | `"8000"` | Maximum combined prompt + response budget enforced when server safe mode is on. Raise only after validating the provider's context window and downstream processing limits. |
| `SAFE_MODE_RESPONSE_RESERVE` | `"512"` | Reserved token budget carved out for responses while safe mode is enabled. Prevents long prompts from exhausting the model's reply window. |
| `SAFE_MODE_TEMPERATURE_CEILING` | `"0.4"` | Highest temperature allowed when safe mode is active. Keeps completions grounded by capping creative variance. |
| `SAFE_MODE_MAX_TOOL_CALLS` | `"1"` | Maximum number of tool calls permitted in a single safe-mode exchange. Increase cautiously when agents rely on multi-step tool plans. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SAFE_MODE` | `true` | Client-side mirror of `SAFE_MODE`. Keep the values in sync so browser logic agrees with server enforcement. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_SVG_NUMERIC_FILTERS` | `true` | Feature flag for SVG numeric filters in the planner UI. Disable if custom deployments hit rendering issues. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPTH_THEME` | `false` | Feature flag enabling additional depth theming. Disable to render the legacy flat palette. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIC_DEPTH` | `false` | Experimental organic depth visuals. Pair with `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPTH_THEME` when exploring the layered look. |
| `GITHUB_PAGES` | `false` | Enables GitHub Pages specific behavior in Next.js builds (base path awareness and export tweaks). Set to `true` for GitHub Pages previews or exports. |
| `SKIP_PREVIEW_STATIC` | `false` | Disables generating preview routes during `next export`. Useful when slimming down GitHub Pages artifacts. |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | `"https://examplePublicKey.ingest.sentry.io/1234567"` | Server-side Sentry DSN. Provide alongside `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` to ship monitoring from production builds. |
| `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` | `"development"` | Human-readable label for server Sentry events (for example, `production` or `preview`). |
| `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` | `"0.25"` | Overrides the default tracing sample rate server-side. Leave empty to rely on Sentry defaults. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` | `"https://examplePublicKey.ingest.sentry.io/1234567"` | Browser Sentry DSN. Must be set when client-side monitoring is required. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` | `"development"` | Human-readable label for browser Sentry events mirroring the server environment. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` | `"0.25"` | Overrides the tracing sample rate for browser spans. Leave empty to inherit Sentry defaults. |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | `""` | Personal access token used by the deploy script to push from CI. Needs `public_repo` scope for public repositories. Leave empty locally when an `origin` remote is configured. |
| `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` | `""` | `owner/repo` slug resolved by the deploy script when no git remote is available (common in CI). |
| `GH_PAGES_BRANCH` | `gh-pages` | Target branch for the GitHub Pages deploy script. Override if your site publishes from a different branch. |
| `GITHUB_PAGES_BRANCH` | `""` | Optional alias the deploy script reads when `GH_PAGES_BRANCH` is unset. Useful when reusing existing CI variables. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_*` | _unset_ | Placeholder namespace for future API endpoints (for example, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`). Prefix additional public URLs with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` so Next.js exposes them to the client. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_GLITCH_LANDING` | `true` | Preferred flag for the glitch landing experience. Set to `false` to render the legacy landing layout without glitch overlays. Supersedes `NEXT_PUBLIC_UI_GLITCH_LANDING`. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_UI_GLITCH_LANDING` | `true` | Legacy alias for `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_GLITCH_LANDING`. Leave enabled for backward compatibility with older builds until they can migrate to the new flag. |
| `NEXT_PHASE` | _unset_ | Optional Next.js phase override for debugging phase-specific logic. The build sets this automatically in most workflows. |
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` | Runtime environment hint used by Next.js. The build pipeline sets this automatically; override only for advanced debugging. |

> **Tip:** Keep `.env.local` out of version control. Only `.env.example` belongs in the repository so collaborators and CI pipelines can discover the supported configuration.

> **Note:** The Sentry defaults above mirror the illustrative placeholders in `.env.example`. Replace the DSN, environment labels, and sample rates with project-specific values before deploying to production.

> **Note:** The gallery usage generator (`pnpm run build-gallery-usage`) defaults both `SAFE_MODE` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SAFE_MODE` to `"true"` when they are missing so CI and local automation stay aligned with `.env.example` without extra setup.

### AI configuration defaults

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and keep `SAFE_MODE` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SAFE_MODE` identical. Mismatched values cause the browser to ignore server safeguards (or vice versa) and can lead to inconsistent token budgeting.
- The stricter `AI_TOKENS_PER_CHAR` default (`3`) intentionally overestimates usage so that long prompts leave enough room for model responses. Raise the value only after validating the provider's tokenizer, or lower it further when integrating models with smaller context windows.
- Safe-mode ceiling variables (`SAFE_MODE_TOKEN_CEILING`, `SAFE_MODE_RESPONSE_RESERVE`, `SAFE_MODE_TEMPERATURE_CEILING`, `SAFE_MODE_MAX_TOOL_CALLS`) should mirror the conservative defaults unless you have validated higher limits with your provider and downstream tooling. Adjust them together so prompts, completions, and tool orchestration remain in sync.

## AI response validation

Use `guardResponse`/`validateSchema` to enforce Zod schemas on AI payloads before they reach the rest of the pipeline. Each call returns a discriminated union so callers can branch on success or failure without parsing concatenated strings:

```ts
import { guardResponse } from "@/ai/safety";

const outcome = guardResponse(rawPayload, schema, { label: "Planner AI" });

if (outcome.success) {
  // use outcome.data
} else {
  outcome.error.issues.forEach(({ path, message }) => {
    console.warn(
      `${outcome.error.label} rejected at ${path.join(".") || "root"}: ${message}`,
    );
  });
}
```

Failures expose the failing `path`, human-readable `message`, and an optional `code` mirroring the underlying Zod `ZodIssue`. Surface this data in logs or UI hints instead of parsing concatenated error strings.

## Metrics reporting and external collectors

Static exports (including GitHub Pages) only submit vitals when a collector URL is supplied. Configure reporting with the following workflow:

1. Decide whether metrics should be shipped from the deployed build. Leave `NEXT_PUBLIC_METRICS_ENDPOINT` empty to disable reporting, or set it to the collector endpoint (absolute URL for remote collectors, relative path when the collector lives behind the same origin). Keep `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_METRICS` at its default of `auto` unless you need to force the hook on or off.
2. Host or reuse a collector:
   - Use the built-in `/api/metrics` Route Handler in [`src/app/api/metrics/route.ts`](src/app/api/metrics/route.ts) for dynamic deployments (Vercel, custom servers).
   - For static environments, deploy the shared Node handler in [`server/metrics-handler.ts`](server/metrics-handler.ts) to a lightweight runtime such as Fly.io, Render, Railway, or a small VPS. The snippet below shows a minimal setup:

     ```ts
     import { createServer } from 'node:http';

     import { handleMetricsRequest } from './server/metrics-handler';

     const server = createServer((req, res) => {
       if (req.url === '/metrics' && req.method === 'POST') {
         void handleMetricsRequest(req, res);
         return;
       }

       res.statusCode = 404;
       res.end();
     });

     server.listen(process.env.PORT ?? 4000);
     ```

   Deploy the collector, note the final URL (for example, `https://<host>/metrics`), and keep it reachable over HTTPS.
3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_METRICS_ENDPOINT` to the deployed collector URL in `.env.local`, GitHub Pages workflow variables, and any other hosting environments so local previews, CI builds, and production exports all point at the same collector.
4. For static hosts that support proxying (for example, Cloudflare Pages workers or Netlify functions), you can mount the handler under the same domain and reference it with a relative path such as `/metrics` to avoid cross-origin configuration.

## Animations

This app respects your operating system's "reduced motion" setting. If reduced motion is enabled, animations will start disabled. You can override this preference at any time using the lightning bolt toggle in the header.

## Design System

Planner ships with a token-driven design system that keeps themes, spacing, and
depth treatments consistent across the app. Reach for the shared primitives
below before introducing custom utility stacks or ad-hoc CSS.

### Component quickstart

#### Hero

- Import from `@/components/ui/layout/Hero` to render page-level intros with
  built-in tabs, search, and glitch overlays.【F:src/components/ui/layout/Hero.tsx†L12-L116】【F:docs/design-system.md†L93-L123】
- Pair `<Hero>` with `<PageShell as="header">` so the hero respects the shared
  shell padding and landmarks; follow with `<PageShell as="main">` for the body
  content.【F:docs/design-system.md†L140-L146】
- Use the `frame` and `glitch` props to opt into the animated neon frame and
  noise textures, and adjust `tabs`, `subTabs`, or `searchBar` to surface
  interactive controls without wiring extra layout wrappers.【F:src/components/ui/layout/Hero.tsx†L45-L120】【F:docs/design-system.md†L93-L123】

#### Card

- Import from `@/components/ui/primitives/Card` to display token-aware panels
  with neumorphic depth. Choose `depth="base"`, `"raised"`, or `"sunken"` to
  align with the shared `shadow-neo` tokens.【F:src/components/ui/primitives/Card.tsx†L1-L71】【F:docs/design-system.md†L210-L218】
- Enable the `glitch` prop to add the animated blob + noise overlay. Cards auto
  detect custom overlays to prevent duplicates, so you can safely layer badges
  or media on top.【F:src/components/ui/primitives/Card.tsx†L36-L70】
- Use the exported `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardContent`, and `CardFooter`
  helpers to apply consistent spacing without recreating token values.【F:src/components/ui/primitives/Card.tsx†L72-L117】

#### PageShell

- Import from `@/components/ui/layout/PageShell` to wrap page sections in the
  shared `page-shell` class. The shell clamps width and applies the responsive
  vertical rhythm defined by the spacing tokens.【F:src/components/ui/layout/PageShell.tsx†L1-L60】【F:docs/design-system.md†L134-L146】
- Pass `grid` to enable the 12-column layout; compose children with Tailwind's
  `col-span-*` utilities and the exported `layoutGridClassName` for consistent
  gutter spacing.【F:src/components/ui/layout/PageShell.tsx†L21-L58】【F:docs/design-system.md†L134-L143】

#### Input

- Import from `@/components/ui/primitives/Input` for form controls that hook
  into the shared `Field` primitive and tokenized focus rings.【F:src/components/ui/primitives/Input.tsx†L1-L107】
- Choose control height with `height="sm" | "md" | "lg" | "xl"` (or a control
  height token) and set `ringTone` to map focus states to semantic color
  tokens.【F:src/components/ui/primitives/Input.tsx†L23-L107】【F:docs/design-system.md†L210-L218】
- Enable glitch styling with the `glitch`/`glitchText` props or reserve trailing
  content slots via `hasEndSlot` when adding icons, spinners, or inline
  actions.【F:src/components/ui/primitives/Input.tsx†L23-L107】

### Token quick reference

#### Theme tokens

- Source tokens live under [`tokens/`](tokens/) and are compiled to CSS
  variables by `pnpm run generate-tokens`. Consume them through semantic Tailwind
  utilities like `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, and gradient helpers (for
  example `bg-panel-tilt-strong`) so theme overrides propagate automatically.【F:README.md†L200-L206】【F:docs/design-system.md†L107-L133】
- Use `docs/design-system.md` and [`tokens/tokens.css`](tokens/tokens.css) to
  locate gradients, glow overlays, and tone-specific text tokens before adding
  new values.【F:docs/design-system.md†L107-L133】

#### Spacing scale

- Global spacing tokens (`--space-1`…`--space-8`) map to 4px increments (4, 8,
  12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64). Page shells, cards, and primitives already consume
  these values via Tailwind classes such as `space-y-[var(--space-6)]` or
  `p-[var(--space-4)]`; match the existing pattern when building new layouts.【F:src/components/ui/layout/PageShell.tsx†L31-L45】【F:src/components/ui/primitives/Card.tsx†L45-L56】【F:docs/design-system.md†L134-L143】

#### 3D effects and depth

- Depth comes from the neumorphic shadow tokens exposed as Tailwind utilities
  (`shadow-neo`, `shadow-neo-strong`, `shadow-neo-inset`). Combine them with the
  hero frame helpers (`NeomorphicHeroFrame`, glitch overlays) to maintain the
  shared 3D look without redefining box-shadows.【F:src/components/ui/primitives/Card.tsx†L13-L57】【F:docs/design-system.md†L107-L133】
- When layering surfaces, prefer semantic elevations (`Card` depth, hero frame
  variants, dropdown shadows) and reuse the existing gradient overlays instead
  of adding new alpha blends.【F:src/components/ui/primitives/Card.tsx†L13-L70】【F:docs/design-system.md†L107-L133】

Learn more in the dedicated [Design System guide](docs/design-system.md).

## Tokens

Generate design tokens as CSS variables, a JavaScript module, and a Markdown reference with:

```bash
pnpm run generate-tokens
```

The script shows a progress bar and runs automatically before `pnpm run build`.

## Profiling React performance

Use the dedicated profiler workflow when you need detailed commit timing data. The `pnpm run profile` command runs the standard prebuild checks, enables the React profiler flags, and launches the dev server with Turbo for faster iteration. Profiling is blocked automatically when `SAFE_MODE` is active so CI and production builds cannot leak profiling bundles. See [docs/profiling.md](docs/profiling.md) for the full workflow.

## Running validation tasks in parallel

The repository ships a composite `pnpm run check` command that executes the core quality gates at the same time. Internally it
invokes `concurrently` to launch the unit tests (`pnpm test -- --run`), ESLint (`pnpm run lint`), the design lint rules (`pnpm run lint:design`),
TypeScript validation (`pnpm run typecheck`), and the artifact guard (`pnpm run guard:artifacts`) in parallel. Use this when you
need a fast all-in-one signal before pushing changes. Pair it with `pnpm run verify-prompts` whenever your edits touch prompt
definitions so the gallery stays in sync.

## Contributing

- Before committing, run `pnpm run verify-prompts` to confirm gallery coverage and `pnpm run check` to execute tests, lint, and type checks.
- Run `pnpm run format` before committing to ensure code style consistency.
- Use `pnpm run commit` to craft Conventional Commits-compliant messages with Commitizen prompts. The command automatically invokes the Commitlint configuration used by the Husky commit hook.
- When introducing new styles or components, add them to the prompts page (`src/app/prompts/page.tsx`) so they can be previewed.
